# E-Signing-Loan-Classification
Using Classification models to predict whether the customer is risky or not for Loan approval based on past Loan data


## We will be performing all the below steps in Feature Engineering

##### Creating new features using the existing features that can be more significantly important for final prediction
##### Handling Missing values                                                                                                                                                            -Temporal variables
##### One-hot encoding on categorical variables
##### Standarise the values of the variables to the same range

 ## Models used for final classification:
 #### ANN
 #### Random Forest
 #### Gradient Boosting
 #### XGBoost Classifier
 #### SVM Classifier
